🗣️ 四、话题卡示例 & 高分回答

🎴 题卡：Describe a special gift you received.
You should say:
– what it was
– who gave it to you
– when you received it
– and explain why it was special

参考回答（约2分钟）：

I’m going to talk about a really special gift I received on my 18th birthday. It was a wristwatch that my father gave me. It wasn’t expensive, but it had a lot of meaning for me.

He gave it to me just after I finished my high school exams. I was under a lot of pressure at the time, and he told me the watch was a symbol of time and responsibility. It had a simple silver design and a leather strap, and I still wear it almost every day.

What made it really special was the message engraved on the back. It said, “Time is life.” That message reminded me to make good use of my time and to never take life for granted.

Even now, years later, I still look at the watch whenever I feel lost or unmotivated. It brings back memories and reminds me of the support my father gave me.
