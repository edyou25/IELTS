✍️ 题目（Opinion Essay）

Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others think that going to classes should be optional.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

📝 高分范文（约280词）

Attending university classes has long been considered an essential part of higher education. While some argue that students should be required to attend every class, others believe that university education should be more flexible and allow students to decide whether to participate in lectures. In my view, regular class attendance should be encouraged but not strictly enforced.

On the one hand, mandatory attendance ensures that students engage actively with the learning process. Lectures provide opportunities for direct interaction with professors, clarification of complex ideas, and engagement in academic discussions. Moreover, many subjects, such as mathematics or engineering, require step-by-step explanation that may be difficult to grasp through self-study alone. Therefore, requiring attendance can contribute to more consistent learning outcomes and better academic performance.

On the other hand, university students are adults and should be trusted to take responsibility for their own education. Forcing attendance may lead to passive participation, where students are physically present but mentally disengaged. In addition, with the increasing availability of online materials, recorded lectures, and digital textbooks, many students may benefit from studying at their own pace and in their preferred style. A flexible approach also accommodates students who work part-time or have other obligations outside university.

In conclusion, although attending classes can greatly enhance academic performance and engagement, it should not be a strict requirement. Universities should focus on motivating students through high-quality teaching and relevant content rather than enforcing attendance policies. Empowering students to manage their own time fosters independence and better prepares them for the real world.
