* 塑料垃圾
in campus.
in my office, we product pastic waste
bags, bottles

but we drop them to the rubish box
and some cleaner will help us to remove them.

but outside the office
sometimes there are pla

maybe they dont mean that.
drop out from thier pocket by inccident.
or there forget to take it away.

i think it is a difficult problem.
because you cannot down let them visit the university.
and you also cannot just fine them.
that is not fair.
to i think it is hard to find a solution

* 喜欢的音乐（queen）

my favorate singer is Freddie Mercury.
he is the lead singer of queen
my favourate song is bohemian rapsody.

i started to knowed him after watching a movie about queen.
the movie is called bohemian rapsody, same as the most famous song.

i dont know much about music, 
like what is rock&roll, and what is what is jazz.

i just feel that the song bohemian rapsody gives me a strong power.
the rythem is beautiful
and the lyrics is inspiring.

i was getting through a tough period of my life.
the lyrisc:
nothing really matters
anyone can see.
really give me a sense of released.
