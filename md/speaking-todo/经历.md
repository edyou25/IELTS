* 印象深刻的英语课(学雅思)
i dont have much money for some launguge edtcation school
and i want to talk about a lesson 
that i teach myself with computer programing.

it is about two month ago.
when i started to prepare for the ielts test
i found that there were big problems with my vocabularies.

i dont have mony to take a course.
and i used to be a software engineer.
so i right a program to teach me.

first ly, i write a seeking function, so search vocabularies online.
secondly, i build a interactive module, to classify the words that i dont know the meaning or pronounciation
then, the program will give me many qiuzes, to remember the words.
and it will stop when i remeber every given words.
finally, i make a connection to the printer in my office.
after the test, it will print a review table.
and i can remember the words on the subway.

i think it is very efficent.
and it is good for someone like me, who can not afford a english course.
and maybe i can start a business from the programe one day.


* 决定等待某事的一次经历(学雅思)

i want to start a phd degree and 
i get a conditional offer.
so i have to pass the english test.

at first, i want to pass the test in two month.
and i just prepare for the test after work.

but i found it was too tired and stressful
i filled exhausted after working overtime as a software engineer.
so i can't study anymore.

so i decided to delay the plan.
firstly, i have changed my job, which has more free time.
and then, i can spend more time to prepare.
i am very glad to make this decision.
i wait for a better chance to study.
becasue it is good for both my physical and mental health.

so i decided changed my job, which has more free time.
i think every problem can be fixed as long as we communicate to each other.

i have so much experience with that.
my mother alway give my cash for gift.

she often send message to me , or my girlfriend.

and ask:
what are you eating?
I haven't had time to answer yet.
she just send another one:
go to eat some delicous food.

and then she just make a online tranfer to me.
usually 100 or 200.

at first, i dont want accept this.
becasue i have a job, and i can make money for my self.

but then i think that she is my mom
we love each other
maybe she is just not at communication and expression.
so that's all right.
we both have our own way to express our love.

i can also see the trees and buildings around my window.
at night, i can see the moom and many stars.
if you choose the right time, maybe you can see some comets.
