* 看到动物的地方


I am a sofeware engineer in a car comepany.

* 🆕 经常去的商店

I used to be a sofeware engineer in a car comepany.
so I buy a car from my own company.

i usually drive to a supermarket called sam's club with my girlfriend.
it is located at about 5 kilometers from my apartment.
i think i go there every two weeks.

because i think, the meat quality in sam's club is good.
this is not an advertisement.
i usually by some beef and chiken and cook for myself and my girlfriend.
we often have some salad, hotpot, or babecue at home. 


i also like to buy some seafood，like shrimps and salmon
i also like some breads and beers here,
and they are for sales only in sam's club
by the way, dont eat seafood and drink Alcohol at the same time.

* 🆕 经常做运动的地方

I am a big fan of sports.
so i usually do sports every two days 
the most popular place of mine is the outdoor swimming pool in my university


i usually go to the pool in the evening.
because at that time, most of sunshine is blocked by other buildings.
so the water is not too hot.
and i can also avoid getting sunburnt.

i am now practicing my freestyle swimming 
and trying to improve my swimming skills.

i really enjoy this process,
because i can keeping thinking and improving
i can always get the sense of achievement.
and i won't be bothered by others.
that feels great.


* 🆕 去过的嘈杂的地方
I am a big fan of sports.
so i usually do sports every two days 
the most popular place of mine is the outdoor swimming pool in my university


i usually go to the pool in the evening.
during the day, the outdoor swimming pool is too hot.
and there are few people.
but in the evening, most of sunshine is blocked by other buildings.
so the water is much cooler.
and the pool is very crowded and noisy.

but i dont care about the noise.
becasue
i just concentrate on improving my swimming skills.

i really enjoy this process,
because i can keeping thinking and improving
i can always get the sense of achievement.
that feels great.

* 🆕 一个你想推荐给旅行者的地方
if someone comes to hk, i want to recommend my university to him/her.
it calls hong kong university of polytechnic
it is in kowloon district in hk 
and it is  near the west kowloon station.

almost all the areas of our campus is always openning to the public.
so you can visit the campus anytime you want.

you can read some books and magazines in the libarary.
or have some picnic on the lawns.

i am realy a swiming fan.
and i can tell you that the swimming pool of our school is really great.
water is clean and comfortable.
so if the traveler bring a swimsuit, 
i will strongly recommmend you to try the swimming pool.


🔵 Old buildings
i have just come to live in hk.
hong kong used to be the colony of british.
its development started from a long time ago.
so there are some old buildings on the street.

honestly, i really dont like old building.
it is very dirty.
i even used to saw some rats near an old buiding.
it is really disgusting.

so in my opinion, if you are comparing an old building to a mordern building.
just select the new one.
it may be more expensive, 
but it is much more safe and clean. 

🔵 Street market

🔵 Car trip


* 去了还想去的城市

i used visit and live in shenzhen for a short period.
and now i am living in hongkong
so i want to talk about shenzhen as somewhere i want to visit again.

i come to shenzhen for a business trip
but in the weekend, i always went out for fun.
i even drived my a car from my hometown to shenzhen
so that i can go shopping

i thinks shenzhen is really a good place for touring.
because everything is very conveniet.
in many other big cities in china, if you go out for dinner.
you could only find resteraunts in large business center.
but you can find local resteraunts everywhere.

and all the delicious foods are very cheap. 


* 想拜访他人的家

now i am living in hongkong
and one of my relatives lives  in shenzhen
i used visit him and live there for a short period.

after graduation, i come to shenzhen for a trip and live in his apartment.
but in the weekend, i always went out for fun.
we always drived her car out for shopping and eating together.

i thinks shenzhen is really a good place for living.
and he really know everything about shenzhen.

in many other big cities in china, if i go out for dinner.
i could only find resteraunts in large business center.
but he can find the location of the small resteraunts everywhere.

and all the foods are very  delicious and cheap. 

and that makes me enjoy the journey.

i want to talk about the outdoor swimming in the evening.
