# Who/Where/when
- I’d like to talk about my girlfriend / a female friend.
- she is my classmate in university, which is Harbin institute of technology.




* 🆕 由不喜欢到喜欢的朋友
- we don't like didn’t like each other at first, but later we start a close relationship
- we attended a same curriculum in the university.
- at that time, i was trying to obtain a high grade to prove my ability and to be become confident.
- but she always got better grade than me.
- and when i enjoyed some time with my friends, i just saw that she always went to the library alone.
- and i identify her as someone who just focus on competition with others.
- and dont have her own hobbies.

- however, after the exam, we met again at the fintess centerin the university.
- after chating with her, i found that she had a very colorful life.
- so i realized that i have been putting prejudice on her and i felt very sorry about that.
- so i apologized to her.
- She was **incredibly** kind and forgave me just at the moment.

- after that we started a close relationship
- and i always  remember not to have such a bias toward others.
- no matter she is a stranger, she is one of my friends

* 🆕 会打扮的朋友
- we attended a same curriculum in the university.
- but I didn't notice her at first.
- Later, at my last year before graduation, we met again in the fitness center.
- but this time i could hardly recognize her.
- because she was well dressed and looked gorgeous.
- and realized that dressed can really change your impression to someone. 

- i think she dressed totally diference in the fitness center and classroom.
- because she want to feel different. 
- in another words 
- she want to shift her emotion between different environment.
- for example, dress more appealing in the gym and dress more simple in the classroom to concentrate on studing.


* 🆕 喜欢种植植物的人
- after graduate, we lived together in many cities in china, 
- including suzhou, shanghai, shenzhen and hong kong.
- we are both engineers but she likes flowers very much.
- in the university, when we start the relationship, she told which kind of flower she likes best.
- and then we bought some seeds online and plant them in the grass in the university.

- i takes a long time before we finally get a flower from a seed.
- however, i smelled deadly bad, and very very discousing, and i was very embarassed at that moment.
- maybe i choose the wrong spieces.
- and after graduation, we always keep some green plants in our home. to product some fresh air. and absorb some polution

* 🆕 你认识的聪明人
- we attended a same curriculum in the university.
- at that time, i was trying to obtain a high grade to prove my ability and to be become confident.
- but she always got better grade than me.

* 🆕 劝你的人
- after graduatig from university, we have worked in shanghai for 2 years.
- one day, she suddently asked me:
- do you want to apply for a phd project in hong kong
- i was very surprised, becasue i have saw someone in my company achieve this.
- but i never think about achieving it myself.
- but she told me that recently, she felt very stressful in her company.
- and that made her didn't want to work anymore and plan to return to the campus.
- so we discussed this plan for a long time.
- finally, i agree that, 
- if we can share another campus life together, it will be a very enjoyable period.
- so now i have a conditional phd offer from a professor
- and i am trying to meet the language requirements.
