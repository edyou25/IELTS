🎴 Part 2 话题：Describe a gift you received
🎤 Part 3 延伸问题：Why do people give gifts to others?

A:

Well, I think people give gifts to express emotions like love, appreciation, or even apology.
This is because gifts are a way to communicate feelings when words might not be enough.
For example, parents often give their children gifts to show support or encouragement, especially on special occasions like birthdays or graduations.
In a way, a gift carries emotional value more than its price.

🎤 雅思口语 Part 3 示例：Gifts & Giving

❓1. Why do people give gifts?

A:
I believe people give gifts to express their emotions—whether it’s love, gratitude, or celebration.
Sometimes, it’s hard to put feelings into words, so a thoughtful gift can do that for us.
For instance, giving someone a book they’ve been wanting shows that you care about their interests.

❓2. What kinds of gifts are popular in your country?

A:
In my country, practical gifts are quite popular, especially among adults.
People often give items like skincare products, electronics, or even gift cards.
For children, toys and clothes are still the most common choices.

❓3. Do men and women prefer different types of gifts?

A:
Yes, in general, they might. Women often appreciate personalized or emotional gifts, like handwritten letters or jewelry.
Men, on the other hand, may prefer something more functional, such as gadgets or tools.
Of course, it also depends on personality rather than just gender.

❓4. Is it better to give handmade gifts or store-bought ones?

A:
Personally, I think handmade gifts are more meaningful because they show effort and thought.
Even something simple like a handwritten card can leave a strong impression.
However, store-bought gifts can be more suitable when you’re short on time or don’t know the person well.

❓5. How has gift-giving changed in recent years?

A:
I think gift-giving has become more digital in recent years.
Many people now send online gift cards or order things from shopping apps instead of buying gifts in person.
Also, social media plays a role—people sometimes give gifts just to post about them, which wasn’t common before.
